This project is intended for Artificial Intelligence & Basic Data Science course's final project. The aim of this project is to analyze and gain insights from a dataset containing apartment information, specifically focusing on the factors influencing apartment prices, the variation in prices over time, and creating predictive models for important outcomes. The project involves exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, and machine learning modelling.
